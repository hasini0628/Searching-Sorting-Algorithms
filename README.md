This repository contains implementations of various Searching and Sorting Algorithms using Python.  
It is created for learning and understanding basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts.

Overview

Searching and Sorting are core concepts in computer science that play a crucial role in efficient data processing.  
This repository demonstrates commonly used algorithms with clear logic and beginner-friendly implementations.
The project is suitable for:
- Undergraduate students  
- Beginners in DSA 
- Exam preparation  
- Coding interview fundamentals  

Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort – Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm  
- Selection Sort – Selects the minimum element iteratively  
- Insertion Sort – Builds the sorted array one element at a time  
- Merge Sort – Divide-and-conquer based efficient sorting algorithm
